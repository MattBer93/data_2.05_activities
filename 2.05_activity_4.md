# 2.05 Activity 4

- Create the rest of the tables in the bank database (at least the `client` and the `card` tables)
- Design and create a new database structure. Justify your changes.
    - Some ideas include renaming columns to ones that make more sense for eg in the table district, adding foreign keys wherever necessary
